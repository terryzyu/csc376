# CSC 376: Distributed Systems

### Course Description ###
An introduction to distributed systems. Topics may include: architecture of distributed systems; networking; datagram-oriented and stream-oriented protocols; network programming (for example, the sockets API); remote procedure call and remote method invocation; processes and threads; code migration; software agents; naming of non-mobile and mobile entities; cryptography and security.

### Tools Used ###
* A Linux distro (LXLE was recommended) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Terminal on Mac

### Notes ###
I'm fairly certain you can use any Linux distro such as Ubuntu, Debian, etc. As long as you have access to the terminal you will be fine. In each of the folders you'll find my Java code and the test files the professor provided. You must compile the Java code prior to running the tests. After compiling you may run the test scripts.
